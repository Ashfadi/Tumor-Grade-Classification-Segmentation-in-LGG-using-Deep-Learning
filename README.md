## üìå Features
- **Tumor Segmentation**: U-Net architecture to precisely localize tumor regions in MRI images.
- **Tumor Grade Classification**: ResNet-based model to predict tumor grade (Grade 1 or 2).
- **Medical Data Augmentation**: Techniques like rotation, flipping, resizing, and color jittering to improve performance.
- **Performance Metrics**: Dice Coefficient for segmentation, Accuracy, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC for classification.

## üè• Problem Statement
- **Lower-Grade Gliomas (LGG)** are slow-growing brain tumors that require precise segmentation and grading for treatment planning.
- **Challenges**:
  - Small dataset size makes deep learning models prone to **underfitting**.
  - **Subtle differences** between normal and tumor tissues complicate segmentation.
  - Generalizing across different MRI scanners is difficult.

This project aims to **automate** the segmentation and classification of LGG tumors to enhance efficiency in **clinical decision-making**.
